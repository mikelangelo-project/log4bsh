## Getting Started
To have the logging functions available in your bash-scripts, you need to
source file `log4bsh.sh` at the begin of your scripts e.g.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source log4bsh/src/log4bash.sh;
#..your code..
logInfoMsg "Hello World!";
#..more of your code..
exit 0;
```



## Prerequisites
At least bash version 4.0 is required, because of associative arrays being used.
Further, following commands need to be available:
 * `sed`
 * `ps`
 * `tail`
 * `mkdir`
 * `tee`



## Installation and Removal
For the installation, use call
```bash
./setup.sh [--prefix=<dir>] [--userspace]
```
To remove log4bsh, use
```bash
./setup.sh [--prefix=<dir>] [--userspace]
```



## Using a Configuration File
If there is no configuration file, the default values listed in the table above
will be applied. However, if you want to change a certain option or all of them,
you can provide a configuration file the following ways:

For a system wide configuration, use file
* `/etc/log4bash.conf`
* If not found in `/etc`, it is searched for in `log4bsh.sh` installation dir.

For an user specific configuration, that overrides a system wide configuration,
use file
* `$HOME/log4bash.conf`
* If not found, it is search for file `$HOME/.log4bash.conf`

You may consider already set environment variables, and apply them only in
in case they are not set. For example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z ${USE_COLORS-} ]; then
  # not set
  USE_COLORS=true;
fi
```


## Using Environment Variables for Configuration
All configuration options can be applied via the environment, too.
This allows you, for example, to enable `DEBUG` or `TRACE` for certain code
section and disable it afterwards again. Or to log the output of specific
sub-scripts into their own log file by providing a dedicated LOG_FILE
setting for each one.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# this file is called by another script that has linked the log4bsh.sh file.
# To write to a separate log file, define it separately in this script
# some options different from the parent script's configuration.
LOG_FILE="/tmp/myScript_XYZ.log";

# ..some code..

# now increase the log level to TRACE
TRACE=true;

# ..some more code where you want to print trace messages..

# now disable trace output again
TRACE=false;

# ..more code..

exit 0;
```

However there is no need to touch your scripts. If you want to modify the log
level for a specific script, you can do so from the outside.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# set overall logging level to WARN, but for myScript.sh set it to TRACE
export  LOG_LEVEL="ALL:WARN,myScript.sh:TRACE";
./myScriptThatUsesLog4bsh.sh
```



## Log Levels
There are 5 different log levels, each one serving a specific purpose.

| Log Level      | Purpose        |
| :---              | :---          |
| TRACE | Most detailed log output, use it to print all details relevant, i.e. ssh verbose output. `TRACE` needs to be enabled. |
| DEBUG | More detailed output, use i.e. to indicate current step of processing. `DEBUG` needs to be enabled. |
| INFO | Info messages, the default message level. Always printed to log. |
| WARN | Warning messages, use it to indicate something is not as expected. Always printed to log. |
| ERROR | Error Message, use it in case you cannot continue with the execution. Always printed to log. |
| NONE | Do not print any log messages. |



## Configuration Options
There are several options available to control the behavior of the logging
functionality. You either can set environment variables providing these settings
or a configuration file.

| Config Parameter      | Description        | Default Value |
| :---              | :---          |:---          |
| `LOG4BSH_CONFIG_FILE`	| Optional configuration file, overrides all others. | `undefined` |
| `LOG_FILE`     | Log file for messages. | `~/.log4bsh.log` |
| `LOG_LEVEL`	| Defines current level for log msgs, allows also to log specific scripts at a certain level | `undefined` (== `ALL:INFO`) |
| `LOG_ROTATE` | Flag indicating to use log rotate. | `TRUE` |
| `MAX_LOG_SIZE` | Maximum size for log files in bytes. | `5242880` (= 5MB) |
| `ABORT_ON_ERROR ` | Flag indicating the default behaviour for error messages |  `TRUE ` |
| `PRINT_TO_STDOUT` | Flag indicating to print messages to log and `STDOUT` | `FALSE` |
| `DATE_FORMAT` | Date format for log messages. | `+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` |
| `USE_COLORS` | Use colors for log messages | `TRUE` |
| `COLORS`	| Allows to override default colors for log levels. Associative array, with keys: TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR | `TRACE->lblue`, `DEBUG->blue`, `INFO->green`, `WARN->orange`, `ERROR->red` |
| `DEBUG` | Indicates to print msg at level 'DEBUG'. Ignored if LOG_LEVEL is set. | `FALSE` |
| `TRACE` | Indicates to print msg at level 'TRACE'. Ignored if LOG_LEVEL is set. | `FALSE` |



## Logging Functions
List of functions provided to you by `log4bsh.sh`.

* **`captureOutputStreams`**
  *  Description:
       Copies the output of `STDOUT` and `STDERR` and writes it to the
       log file. Very useful for scheduled execution or other
       situations where you do not have the `STDOUT` available on your
       screen while the script runs.
  *  Parameter:
     * `$1`: Optional flag, force capturing that happens per default in case
          `DEBUG` or `TRACE` is enabled, only.
  *  Returns:
     * `0`: in case of success, redirection is enabled
     * `1`: if not enabled, e.g. DEBUG not active

* **`stopOutputCapturing`**
  *  Description:
       Stops the redirection of `STDOUT` and `STDERR` streams.
  *  Parameter:
       none
  *  Returns:
     * `0`: in case of success
     * `1`: if streams where not captured (nothing to do)

* **`getCallerName`**
  *  Description:
       Internal function to get the name of script/parent process that called
       your script.
