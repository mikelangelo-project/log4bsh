## Getting Started
To have the logging functions available in your bash-scripts, you either need to run the
`setup.sh` or to source file `log4bsh.sh` at the begin of your scripts e.g.

```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 source log4bsh/src/log4bash.sh; #not needed if setup.sh was run
 #..your code..
 logInfoMsg "Hello World!";
 #..more of your code..
 exit 0;
```



## Prerequisites
At least bash version 4.0 is required, because of associative arrays being used.  
Further, following commands need to be available:
 * `mkdir` (package [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html))
 * `tail` (package [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html))
 * `tee` (package [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html))
 * `ps` (package [procps](http://procps.sourceforge.net/))
 * `sed` (package sed [procps](http://sed.sourceforge.net/))



## Installation and Removal
To install log4bsh, run command
```
./setup.sh [--prefix=<dir>] [--userspace]
```
If you do not provide a prefix log4bsh is installed to `/usr/share/log4bsh/`
or to `$HOME/lib/log4bsh/` in case of an userspace installation.
Make use of `--userspace` if you want to install it for your user, only.
A system wide installation requires root permissions.

To remove log4bsh, use
```
./setup.sh --uninstall [--prefix=<dir>] [--userspace]
```



## Using a Configuration File
If there is no configuration file, the default values will be applied,
see [Configuration Options](#configuration-options).  
However, if you want to change a certain option or all of them, you can
provide a configuration file in the following ways:

For a system wide configuration, use file
* `/etc/log4bash.conf`
* If not found in `/etc`, it is searched for in `log4bsh.sh` installation dir.

For an user specific configuration, that overrides a system wide configuration,
use file
* `$HOME/log4bash.conf`
* If not found, it is search for file `$HOME/.log4bash.conf`

Note: You may consider already set environment variables, and apply them only in
in case they are not set. For example:
```bash
 #!/bin/bash
 if [ -z ${USE_COLORS-} ]; then
   # not set
   USE_COLORS=true;
 fi
```


## Using Environment Variables for Configuration
All configuration options can also be set inside scripts. This allows you, for
example, to enable flag `DEBUG` or `TRACE` for a code section and disable it
afterwards again.

```bash
 #!/bin/bash

 # ..some code..

 # now increase the log level to TRACE
 TRACE=true;

 # ..some more code where you want to print trace messages..

 # now disable trace output again
 TRACE=false;

 # ..more code..

 exit 0;
```

However, there is no need to touch your scripts. If you want to modify the log
level for a specific script, you can do so before executing your script from the
outside by the help of environment variables .
```bash
 # set overall logging level to WARN, but for myScript.sh set it to TRACE
 export LOG_LEVEL="ALL:WARN,myScript.sh:TRACE";
 ./myScript.sh
```

## Dedicated Log Files
You have the opportunity to define by the help of hook function
`log4bsh_getLogFileName` dedicated log files, dependent on the script that
logs messages.

```bash
 # write 'myScript.sh' messages to a separate log file, but all others to the
 # default log file '$LOG_FILE'
 log4bsh_getLogFileName() {
   if [ "${1-}" == "myScript.sh" ]; then
     echo "/tmp/myScript.log";
   else
     echo "$LOG_FILE";
   fi
 }
```


## Log Levels
There are 5 different log levels, in addition to `QUIET`, each one serving a specific purpose.
Lowest level is `ERROR`, default level is `INFO` and most verbose log level is `TRACE`.

| Log Level      | Purpose        |
| :---              | :---          |
| TRACE | Most detailed log output, use it to print all details relevant, e.g. content of generated files. |
| DEBUG | More detailed output, use e.g. to indicate current step of processing. |
| INFO | Info messages, the default log level. Always logged except log level `QUIET` is set. |
| WARN | Warning messages, use it to indicate something is not as expected. Always logged, except log level `QUIET` is set. |
| ERROR | Error messages, use it to indicate sth went wrong. Always logged, except log level `QUIET` is set. |
| QUIET | Do not log any messages. |



## Configuration Options
There are several options available to control the behavior of the logging
functionality.
You either can set environment variables providing these settings
or use a configuration file as described in sections
[Using Environment Variables for Configuration](#using-environment-variables-for-configuration)
and [Using a Configuration File](#using-a-configuration-file).

| Config Parameter      | Description        | Default Value |
| :---              | :---          |:---          |
| `LOG4BSH_CONFIG_FILE` | Optional configuration file, overrides all others. | `undefined` |
| `LOG_FILE` | Log file for messages. | `~/.log4bsh.log` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Defines current level for log msgs, allows also to log specific scripts at a certain level | `undefined` (== `ALL:INFO`) |
| `LOG_ROTATE` | Flag indicating to use log rotate. | `TRUE` |
| `MAX_LOG_SIZE` | Maximum size for log files in bytes. | `5242880` (= 5MB) |
| `ABORT_ON_ERROR` | Flag indicating the default behavior for error messages |  `TRUE ` |
| `PRINT_TO_STDOUT` | Flag indicating to print messages to log and `STDOUT` | `FALSE` |
| `DATE_FORMAT` | Date format for log messages. | `+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S` |
| `USE_COLORS` | Use colors for log messages | `TRUE` |
| `COLORS` | Allows to override default colors for log levels. Associative array, with keys: TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR | `TRACE->lblue`, `DEBUG->blue`, `INFO->green`, `WARN->orange`, `ERROR->red` |
| `DEBUG` | Indicates to print msg at level 'DEBUG' or below. Ignored if LOG_LEVEL is set. | `FALSE` |
| `TRACE` | Indicates to print msg at level 'TRACE' or below. Ignored if LOG_LEVEL is set. | `FALSE` |

                   your (sub-)scripts in the logging output.
  *  Parameter:
     * `$1`: Name of a script or process.

                   dependent on the actual script's name that logs messages.
  *  Parameter:
     * `$1`: Name of a script or process.
